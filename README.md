# Data Analysis of HDB Resale Prices, 1990 - 2020

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on HDB resale prices from 1990 to 2020. In this project, several factors, including transaction year, floor size, flat type and town, are analysed for their relationship with resale prices. The dataset is taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teyang/singapore-hdb-flat-resale-prices-19902020/data), which was obtained from data.gov.sg. The original dataset contains records of over 800,000 resale flats in the past three decades.

The motivation for the project was twofold: firstly, I was curious about the trends in Singapore's property market over the years and I wanted to see if there were any interesting insights that I could derive from it; and secondly, I wanted to work on a hands-on project that would allow me to better my skills at data analysis, and I figured that such a dataset was of an appropriate complexity for me to tinkle around with and learn from.

The EDA is done in Python on Jupyter Notebook. Packages used are pandas for analysis, and matplotlib and seaborn for data visualisation. A list of references used is included at the end of the file.

# Future Work

Future work on the project could include building predictive models for resale HDBs with regression analysis/machine learning.
